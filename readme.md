###General
Rather than cloning the repo into your home folder, I would recommend creating a .bash folder in your home folder and then creating symlinks for the bash config files (See instructions below).

###OSX Installation:
    mkdir ~/.bash
    git clone git://github.com/wburningham/bash_config.git ~/.bash
	 ln -s ~/.bash/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile

###Linux Installation:
    mkdir ~/.bash
    git clone git://github.com/wburningham/bash_config.git ~/.bash
	 ln -s ~/.bash/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
	 ln -s ~/.bash/root/.bashrc /root/.bashrc
